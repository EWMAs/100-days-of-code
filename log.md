# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, April 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to work on my old projects with my new setup (Git and Oh My Zhs). Reviewed WTJ code to extract list of job openings. Spent a bunch of time trying to extract the JSON data in between script tags from the job description URL. Ended up posting on StackOverflow. Hopefully someone can help out with this otherwise I don't know how I'm going to move forward!

**Thoughts** Lots of time reviewing the work I did a couple of weeks ago, Googling and OverStackflowing, not a lot of time coding and no progress made as far as the project goes (ie still haven't cleared the roadblock to extract job description)
